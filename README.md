Data Scientist Survey Analysis - README
Installation
The code was written in Python 3 and requires the following packages: Pandas, Numpy, Collections, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy and Warnings.

Project Motivation
The motivation behind this analysis is to explore how data scientists compare with other non-data scientist software developers ("non-data scientists") with regard to demographics, programming languages used, coding experience and job satisfaction. Consequently, in this analysis, I set out to answer the following questions, using data collected by Stack Overflow as part of their 2018 Annual Developer Survey:

How does the demographic profile of data scientists differ from that of non-data scientists?
What programming languages do data scientists favour and how do they differ from those used by non-data scientists?
How much coding experience do data scientists have compared to non-data scientists?
Are data scientists more satisfied with their jobs/careers than non-data scientists?
File Descriptions
All analysis is contained in the Jupyter notebook DS Survey Analysis.ipynb.

To run this code, it is first necessary to download the 2018 [Stackoverflow dataset 2018](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) . The folder containing this data (developer_survey_2018) should then be saved in the current working directory in a folder named "Data".

Results
The main findings of this analysis are summarised in a blog post available [here](https://medium.com/@samratnilesh098/data-scientist-reality-according-to-stack-overflow-surveying-data-1a45a101e55d).
